Project Overview

This project was born from my personal struggles with time management and study habits. I wanted to create something that would not only help me but also others who are going through a similar experience. The website offers users the choice to either study alone or connect with someone online for a more collaborative experience.
Key Features

    Study Mode Options: Choose between studying solo or with an online partner.
    Time Management Tools: Track your study sessions and break times to ensure efficient time use.
    Collaborative Learning: Connect with others online to boost productivity and motivation through shared study sessions.
